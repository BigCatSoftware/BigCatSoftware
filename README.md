# üëã Hi, I'm Tiger Schueler!

I'm a U.S. Navy veteran and senior at the **University of Washington Tacoma**, pursuing a **B.S. in Computer Science and Systems** (Graduating August 2025). My focus is on **backend** and **systems development**, primarily in **Python** and **Java**, with additional experience in **C++**, **C#**, and SQL-based applications.

I bring a mix of **leadership and teamwork** from my Navy service and strong **software engineering fundamentals** developed through coursework and collaborative projects. While my current career goal is to secure an **entry-level software engineering role** in backend or systems programming, I‚Äôm also building skills in **AI, NLP, and machine learning** through upcoming coursework and self-study in statistical analysis.

My projects range from **compiler extensions** and **emulators** to **RPG game development**, showcasing problem-solving, algorithmic thinking, and a commitment to writing clean, maintainable code.

## üöÄ Projects

### [J-- Compiler Extensions](https://github.com/BigCatSoftware/j--)
Extended the j-- compiler (a Java subset) by modifying the scanner, parser, and semantic analyzer to support additional Java constructs including do-until loops, switch, and try-catch. Implemented type checking, symbol table updates, and contributed to JVM bytecode generation for control flow and exception handling.

### [CHIP-8 Emulator](https://github.com/BigCatSoftware/chip-8)
A minimal emulator built in C++ using SDL3, supporting classic CHIP-8 ROMs like the IBM logo demo. Demonstrates instruction decoding, rendering, and systems-level understanding.

### [Game Server Admin Tool](https://github.com/BigCatSoftware/WizzardGamesGUI)
A Windows Forms dashboard in C# connected to SQL Server, enabling game server management, analytics, and data visualization through stored procedures and UI controls.

### [Dungeon Adventure](https://github.com/BigCatSoftware/Dungeon-Adventure)
A 2D dungeon RPG built in Java with LibGDX featuring procedurally generated dungeons, combat, inventory, and stat systems. Collaborated with two developers using Agile methodology and weekly sprint planning.
