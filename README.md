# Hi there, I'm Tiger Schueler! üëã

I'm a Computer Science and Systems (CSS) student at the University of Washington Tacoma, with a strong passion for **low-level programming**, **systems development**, and **security-focused software design**. My interests lie in exploring the inner workings of computers, from the depths of operating systems and compilers to the intricacies of secure coding and cryptography. Over the course of my senior year, I will be diving deeper into these topics to prepare for future opportunities in systems programming, cybersecurity, and performance-critical software development.

## üîß Skills & Technologies
- **Languages:** Java (primary), C++ (currently learning)
- **Technologies:** LibGDX, Git
- **Specialties:** Game Development (Java & LibGDX), Data Structure and Algorithms (DSA)

## üìö Currently Learning
- **C++** to deepen my understanding of systems-level programming and low-level design.
- **Data Structures and Algorithms** to strengthen my problem-solving abilities.
- Preparing for courses in **Secure Coding Principles**, **Database System Design**, **AI & Knowledge Acquisition**, **Cryptography**, and **Natural Language Processing** to build a strong foundation in both theory and practical application.

## üéØ Future Goals 
- Aiming for a **summer internship in 2025** by building expertise in C++, secure coding practices, and systems programming.
- Developing a portfolio of projects that demonstrate a deep understanding of low-level concepts, performance optimization, and secure software design.

## üíª Featured Projects
- [**Dungeon Adventure**](https://github.com/BigCatSoftware/Dungeon-Adventure): A 2D dungeon RPG developed using Java and LibGDX, featuring a Binary Space Partitioning (BSP) algorithm for randomly generated dungeons. The game also includes combat mechanics, item management, and stat tracking.

## üìö Senior Courses I'm Excited About
- **TCSS 421 - Compiler Construction:** Learning how to build compilers and understand language parsing and optimization techniques.
- **TCSS 422 - Computing Operating Systems:** Diving deep into process management, memory allocation, and other core OS concepts.
- **TCS 483 - Secure Coding Principles:** Focusing on writing safe, secure code to prevent vulnerabilities.
- **TCSS 445 - Database System Design:** Exploring efficient data management and storage strategies.
- **TCSS 435 - AI & Knowledge Acquisition:** Studying algorithms and techniques for building intelligent systems.
- **TCSS 487 - Intro to Cryptography:** Understanding encryption methods and secure communications.
