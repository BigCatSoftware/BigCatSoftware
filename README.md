# Hey there, I'm Tiger Schueler! ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m currently a **Computer Science and Systems (CSS)** student at the **University of Washington Tacoma**, and Iâ€™m excited to be heading into my senior year with a **minor in Mathematics**. I have a keen interest in **low-level systems programming**, **AI**, and **machine learning**. The current tech boom in AI fascinates me, especially how itâ€™s weaving its way into various sectors and changing the way we interact with software and data.

## ðŸ’¡ What I'm Focused On:
As I enter my final year, Iâ€™m working hard to sharpen my skills in **systems design**, **AI**, **machine learning**, and **mathematical reasoning**. I'm eager to apply what I learn to create efficient, secure, and scalable solutions that make a real impact in the tech world.

### ðŸŽ“ Senior Year Courses:
Hereâ€™s a glimpse of the exciting courses I'll be diving into this year:

#### **Winter 2025**
- **Computer Architecture (TCSS 372)**
- **Introduction to Machine Learning (TCSS 455)**
- **Database Systems Design (TCSS 445)**

#### **Spring 2025**
- **Operating Systems (TCSS 422)**
- **Introduction to Natural Language Processing (TCSS 456)**
- **Database System Internals (TCSS 446)**

#### **Autumn 2025**
- **Mathematical Reasoning (TMATH 300)**
- **AI & Knowledge Acquisition (TCSS 435)**
- **Cryptography (TCSS 487)**

## ðŸ›  Skills & Technologies:
Hereâ€™s a quick overview of the skills and tools I've picked up along the way:
- **Languages**: Java (Primary Language), C++ (Beginner), Python (Beginner)
- **Technologies**: Git, Linux, LibGDX

## ðŸš€ Projects:
Hereâ€™s a showcase of some of the work Iâ€™ve done:

- [**Dungeon Adventure**](https://github.com/BigCatSoftware/Dungeon-Adventure): A 2D dungeon RPG featuring randomly generated dungeons, combat mechanics, item management, and player stats, built using Java and LibGDX.

## ðŸŽ¯ Future Goals:
- Land a **software engineering internship in summer 2025** to gain hands-on experience and get ready to jump into the industry.
- Secure a **Software Engineer** role after graduating in **Autumn 2025**, where I can put my skills to use and develop innovative software that tackles real-world challenges.
