# Hey there, I'm Tiger Schueler! ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m currently a senior studying **Computer Science and Systems (CSS)** with a minor in **Mathematics** at the **University of Washington Tacoma**. My interests span **software engineering**, **AI**, and **data science**, with a growing interest in **Python**. I'm also interested in **blockchain technology** and **financial data programming**. It's an exciting time to be studying CSS, especially given the rapid technological advancements in recent years. As I prepare to enter the software field, I'm eager to explore opportunities in software development, AI development, data science, or any role where I can apply my skills to make a meaningful impact.

## ðŸ’¡ What I'm Focused On:
As I wrap up my final year, I'm focused on deepening my expertise in **Python programming**, **data structures and algorithms**, and building a strong mathematical foundation. While I'm relatively new to **blockchain technology**, **financial data analysis**, and **artificial intelligence**, I'm actively exploring these exciting fields. I'm eager to apply my skills to design efficient, scalable systems, and to contribute to the ever-evolving tech landscape.

### ðŸŽ“ Senior Year Courses:
Hereâ€™s a glimpse of the exciting courses I'm taking this year:

#### **Winter 2025 (Completed)**

## ðŸ›  Skills & Technologies:
Hereâ€™s a quick overview of the skills and tools I've picked up along the way:
- **Languages**: Java (Primary Language), C# (Beginner), C++ (Beginner), Python (Beginner)
- **Technologies**: Git, Linux, LibGDX

## ðŸš€ Projects:
Hereâ€™s a showcase of some of the work Iâ€™ve done:

- [**Dungeon Adventure**](https://github.com/BigCatSoftware/Dungeon-Adventure): A 2D dungeon RPG featuring randomly generated dungeons, combat mechanics, item management, and player stats, built using Java and LibGDX.

- [**CHIP-8 Emulator**](https://github.com/BigCatSoftware/chip-8): A C++ emulator for the CHIP-8 interpreter, originally implemented on the COSMAC VIP. This project uses **SDL3** for rendering and has been a valuable learning experience in low-level programming.

## ðŸŽ¯ Future Goals:
- Graduate with my **B.S. in Computer Science & Systems (CSS)** with a minor in Mathematics in **Summer 2025**.
- Secure a **Software Engineer** role after graduating, that allows me to apply my technical skills and continue growing as a professional.
- Expand my technical toolkit through hands-on experience and continuous learning in the workplace.
