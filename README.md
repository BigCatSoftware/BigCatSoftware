## üöÄ Projects

### [J-- Compiler Extensions](https://github.com/BigCatSoftware/j--)  
Extended the **j-- compiler** (a Java subset) by modifying the scanner, parser, and semantic analyzer to support additional Java constructs including **do-until loops, switch, and try-catch**. Implemented type checking and symbol table updates to integrate these features into the compiler pipeline.  

### [Dungeon Adventure](https://github.com/BigCatSoftware/Dungeon-Adventure)  
A 2D dungeon RPG built in **Java (LibGDX)** with **procedurally generated dungeons, combat, inventory, and stat systems**. Collaborated with two teammates using Agile sprints.  

### [N-Gram Language Model](https://github.com/BigCatSoftware/ngram_language_model)  
A statistical language model in **Python** with unigram and bigram models, Add-k smoothing, sentence probability calculation, and perplexity scoring.  

### [CHIP-8 Emulator](https://github.com/BigCatSoftware/chip-8)  
A minimal emulator in **C++/SDL3** supporting classic CHIP-8 ROMs. Demonstrates instruction decoding and rendering.

### [Game Server Admin Tool](https://github.com/BigCatSoftware/WizzardGamesGUI)  
A **C# Windows Forms dashboard** with **SQL Server** backend for game server management, analytics, and data visualization.
