# Hey there, I'm Tiger Schueler! ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m currently a senior studying **Computer Science and Systems (CSS)** at the **University of Washington Tacoma**. My interests span **systems design**, **low-level programming**, and **software engineering** in general, with a growing curiosity for **AI** and **machine learning**. It's an exciting time to be studying CSS, especially given the rapid technological advancements in recent years. As I prepare to enter the software field, I'm eager to explore opportunities in systems development, game development, or any role where I can apply my skills to make a meaningful impact.

## ðŸ’¡ What I'm Focused On:
As I wrap up my final year, I'm focused on deepening my expertise in **systems design** and **low-level programming** through courses like **Computer Architecture**, **Operating Systems**, and **Compiler Construction**. I'm also expanding my knowledge of **AI** and **machine learning**, with courses like **Introduction to Machine Learning** and **Natural Language Processing**. I'm eager to apply these skills to design efficient, scalable, and secure systems, and to contribute to the ever-evolving tech landscape.

### ðŸŽ“ Senior Year Courses:
Hereâ€™s a glimpse of the exciting courses I'll be diving into this year:

#### **Winter 2025**
- **Computer Architecture (TCSS 372)**
- **Compiler Construction (TCSS 421)**
- **Database Systems Design (TCSS 445)**

#### **Spring 2025**
- **Operating Systems (TCSS 422)**
- **Client/Server Programming for Internet Applications (TCSS 460)**
- **Database System Internals (TCSS 446)**

#### **Summer 2025**
- **Introduction to Machine Learning (TCSS 455)**
- **Introduction to Natural Language Processing (TCSS 456)**
- **Cryptography (TCSS 487)** or **Artificial Intelligence & Knowledge Acquisition (TCSS 435)**

## ðŸ›  Skills & Technologies:
Hereâ€™s a quick overview of the skills and tools I've picked up along the way:
- **Languages**: Java (Primary Language), C# (Beginner), C++ (Beginner), Python (Beginner)
- **Technologies**: Git, Linux, LibGDX

## ðŸš€ Projects:
Hereâ€™s a showcase of some of the work Iâ€™ve done:

- [**Dungeon Adventure**](https://github.com/BigCatSoftware/Dungeon-Adventure): A 2D dungeon RPG featuring randomly generated dungeons, combat mechanics, item management, and player stats, built using Java and LibGDX.

- [**CHIP-8 Emulator**](https://github.com/BigCatSoftware/chip-8): A work-in-progress C++ emulator for the CHIP-8 interpreter, originally implemented on the COSMAC VIP. This project is still in the refactor stage and uses **SDL3** for rendering, but it's been a great learning experience.

## ðŸŽ¯ Future Goals:
- Graduate with my **B.S. in Computer Science & Systems (CSS)** in **Summer 2025**.
- Secure a **Software Engineer** role after graduating, where I can apply my skills in systems design, low-level programming, and more to develop innovative software that solves real-world challenges.
