## üöÄ Projects

### [J-- Compiler Extensions](https://github.com/BigCatSoftware/j--)
Extended the j-- compiler (a Java subset) by modifying the scanner, parser, and semantic analyzer to support additional Java constructs including do-until loops, switch, and try-catch. Implemented type checking, symbol table updates, and contributed to JVM bytecode generation for control flow and exception handling.

### [CHIP-8 Emulator](https://github.com/BigCatSoftware/chip-8)
A minimal emulator built in C++ using SDL3, supporting classic CHIP-8 ROMs like the IBM logo demo. Demonstrates instruction decoding, rendering, and systems-level understanding.

### [Game Server Admin Tool](https://github.com/BigCatSoftware/WizzardGamesGUI)
A Windows Forms dashboard in C# connected to SQL Server, allowing game server management, analytics, and data visualization through stored procedures and UI controls.

### [Dungeon Adventure](https://github.com/BigCatSoftware/Dungeon-Adventure)
A 2D dungeon RPG built in Java with LibGDX featuring procedurally generated dungeons, combat, inventory, and stat systems.
