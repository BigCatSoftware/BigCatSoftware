# Hey, I'm Tiger Schueler! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a **Computer Science and Systems (CSS)** student at the **University of Washington Tacoma**, entering my senior year with a **minor in Mathematics**. Iâ€™m passionate about **low-level systems programming**, **security**, and **artificial intelligence**. My coursework reflects a focus on learning topics like **computer architecture**, **compiler construction**, **operating systems**, and **machine learning**, all while building a strong mathematical foundation that complements my computer science studies.

## ðŸ’¡ What I'm Focused On:
As I enter my final year, Iâ€™m honing my skills in **systems design**, **AI**, **security**, and **mathematical reasoning**. I aim to apply this knowledge to solve real-world problems in software development, with a focus on building **efficient**, **secure**, and **scalable** systems.

### ðŸŽ“ Senior Year Courses:
Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the key courses Iâ€™ll be taking during my senior year:

#### **Winter 2025**
- **Computer Architecture (TCSS 372)**
- **Compiler Construction (TCSS 421)**
- **Introduction to Machine Learning (TCSS 455)**

#### **Spring 2025**
- **Operating Systems (TCSS 422)**
- **Introduction to Cryptography (TCSS 487)**
- **Introduction to Natural Language Processing (TCSS 456)**

#### **Autumn 2025**
- **Database Systems Design (TCSS 445)**
- **AI & Knowledge Acquisition (TCSS 435)**
- **Mathematical Reasoning (TMATH 300)**

## ðŸ›  Skills & Technologies:
Hereâ€™s a snapshot of the tools and skills Iâ€™ve developed throughout my academic journey:
- **Languages**: Java (primary), C++(beginner), Python(beginner)
- **Technologies**: LibGDX, Git, Linux

## ðŸš€ Projects:
Hereâ€™s a showcase of some of the work Iâ€™ve done:

- [**Dungeon Adventure**](https://github.com/BigCatSoftware/Dungeon-Adventure): A 2D dungeon RPG featuring randomly generated dungeons, combat mechanics, item management, and player stats, built using Java and LibGDX.

## ðŸŽ¯ Future Goals:
- Securing an **internship in summer 2025** focused on **systems programming**, **AI**, or **cybersecurity**.
- Securing a **Software Engineer** role after graduating in **Autumn 2025**, where I can apply my skills in **systems programming**, **AI**, and **security** to develop efficient and secure software solutions.
